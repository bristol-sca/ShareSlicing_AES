Sampling Rate: 	250MSa/s
Samples:	600
Scope:		Picoscope 2206B
Clock source:	12MHz internal
LowPass filter:	Off
Amplifier:	On
Vertical Resolution:	-0.15V +/- 500MV
Measurement:	200traces as one batch, each trace will be refreshed with new randomness, yet with the same unshared value
Only the target multiplication will be repeated 200 times(not the whole cipher).
Num of traces:	200*500K=100M
